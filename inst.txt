▌ Put together a research plan for getting to know this repo inside and out. The end goal is to distill a
▌ configuration and feature flags 8) quality gates like tests, coverage threshholds and integration, linters
▌ formatters etc 9) performance and limits 10) MOST IMPORTANT naming patterns, conventions, mental model,
▌ patterns, how to build on top of it, etc.  ALSO VERY IMPORTANT where does this diverge from traditional CSP
▌ solvers, how is it the same. Build a glossary of important terms and how they are used.

> Here’s a focused, end‑to‑end research plan tailored to this repo so you can produce a first‑class overview.md.

  Goals & Outputs

  - Map intent and scope: what CSP‑Rules is, what domains/puzzles it supports.
  - Explain architecture: generic core vs application modules, runtime, data flow.
  - Catalog data/state models and the rule system.
  - Document public surface: how to run, main functions, configurations.
  - Detail configuration/feature flags and how rule sets are chosen.
  - Capture quality gates, performance levers, limits.
  - Most important: naming patterns, conventions, mental model for extending.
  - Contrast with traditional CSP solvers.
  - Build a glossary.

  Quick Repo Orientation

  - Core engine and generic rules: CSP-Rules-Generic (CSP-Rules-Generic/CSP-Rules-Generic-Loader.clp:1)
  - Application modules (per puzzle): SudoRules-V20.1, LatinRules-V2.1, FutoRules-V2.1, KakuRules-V2.1,
  HidatoRules-V2.1, SlitherRules-V2.1, MapRules-V2.1
  - CLIPS binaries and core: CLIPS/ (CLIPS/clips, clips.exe)
  - Configuration entrypoints (per app): e.g., SudoRules-V20.1-config.clp
  - Docs and updates: README.md:1, UPDATES.md:1, Docs/
  - External helpers: XTERNS/ (optional integrations)

  Plan Phase 1 — Baseline Context

  - Read top-level docs to anchor terminology and approach.
      - Purpose and approach: README.md:1 (pattern‑based solver using CLIPS; “progressive domain restriction”,
  chains).
      - Change history and current features: UPDATES.md:1.
      - Manuals/PDFs (skim): Docs/2023-UMRN-r1.pdf.
  - Note the included CLIPS binaries and version expectations (README, CLIPS/).

  Plan Phase 2 — Build & Run Smoke Test

  - Run Sudoku end-to-end in CLIPS to verify the setup and capture a baseline log.
      - Start CLIPS: ./CLIPS/clips
      - In REPL:
          - (load "SudoRules-V20.1-config.clp") (confirm ?*CSP-Rules* points to your local path in SudoRules-
  V20.1-config.clp:36).
          - (load ?*CSP-Rules-Generic-Loader*) (CSP-Rules-Generic/CSP-Rules-Generic-Loader.clp:1)
          - (load ?*Application-Loader*) (SudoRules-V20.1/SudoRules-Loader.clp:1)
          - Optional: (watch rules) and (watch facts) briefly, then (watch none).
          - Solve a demo: use the grid forms in SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/solve.clp:1184 via (solve-sudoku-
  grid ...).
  - Record: init time, solve time, rule firings, density, link counts. See generic timing in CSP-Rules-Generic/
  GENERAL/solve.clp:63 and Sudoku solve helpers in SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/solve.clp:1184.

  Plan Phase 3 — Architecture At A Glance

  - Generic core
      - Loader orchestrates modules and rule sets: CSP-Rules-Generic/CSP-Rules-Generic-Loader.clp:1
      - Templates (data contracts): CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/templates.clp:79 (candidate), 101 (g-candidate), 123
  (csp-variable)
      - Globals and runtime: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/globals.clp:1
      - Basic resolution theory (BRT): singles + ECP; rule saliences: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/ECP.clp:31, CSP-
  Rules-Generic/GENERAL/Single.clp (scan), CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/saliences.clp
      - Links init and play entry: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/init-links.clp:39 and .../play.clp
      - Chains (common, exotic, speed/memory variants): CSP-Rules-Generic/CHAIN-RULES-*
      - T&E + DFS: CSP-Rules-Generic/T&E+DFS/
  - Application layer (use Sudoku as canonical example)
      - Loader and modules: SudoRules-V20.1/SudoRules-Loader.clp:1
      - App templates extending candidate/g-candidate: SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/templates.clp:34
      - Background and label system (rc/rn/cn/bn + links): SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/background.clp:31, 407, 430
      - Per‑app rules (NS/HS/Subsets/Uniqueness/Exotic): SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/, .../SUBSETS/, .../
  UNIQUENESS/, .../EXOTIC/
      - Solve orchestration and public functions: SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/solve.clp:1080 (grid helpers), 1184
  (solve-sudoku-grid)
      - File/Batch solvers: SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/solve-files.clp:1
      - Stats and comparisons: SudoRules-V20.1/STATS/
  - External/Optional:
      - XTERNS/GSF (reference solver sources in C), not required for core flows.

  Deliverable: a concise diagram capturing core -> loader -> modules -> rules -> solve run loop, and the data flow
  (init facts -> candidates -> links -> rule firings -> eliminations/assertions -> solved).

  Plan Phase 4 — Data & State Model

  - Candidate model (status, label, context, flag): CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/templates.clp:79
  - App extensions for Sudoku (number/row/column/block/square): SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/templates.clp:34
  - Structural facts: csp-variable, is-csp-variable-for-label, typed variants: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/
  templates.clp:123
  - Link model and computation:
      - Logical “labels-linked” and typed forms: SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/background.clp:407, 430
      - Effective link assertion process: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/init-links.clp:63
  - Runtime globals (counts, density, context, depths, timing): CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/globals.clp:43, 78
  - Capture how contradictions are detected (no candidate left for a variable) and contexts are used by T&E/DFS.

  Deliverable: a compact schema of core facts (candidate/g-candidate/csp-variable), link types, and key runtime
  globals.

  Plan Phase 5 — Public Surface Area

  - CLIPS REPL use and load order (config → generic loader → app loader).
  - Generic solve entry: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/solve.clp:63 (init/solve pattern).
  - App solve helpers:
      - Sudoku inline grids: SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/solve.clp:1184 (solve-sudoku-grid ...)
      - Batch/file functions: SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/solve-files.clp:63 and friends
      - Preferences flow: SudoRules-V20.1/MODULES/solve-w-preferences.clp:93 (solve-w-prefs ...)
  - Document expected inputs (string grids, list formats), outputs (trace lines, stats), and how to toggle
  verbosity.

  Deliverable: guide bullets with minimal CLIPS snippets and common workflows.

  Plan Phase 6 — Configuration & Feature Flags

  - Per-app config files (e.g., SudoRules-V20.1-config.clp:1) hold:
      - Install paths and environment: ?*CSP-Rules*, ?*Directory-symbol*
      - Resolution theory selection (enable/disable rule families), chain optimization (SPEED vs MEMORY)
      - Print verbosity, “blocked vs unblocked” behavior for certain rule families
  - Generic globals (rule sets, defaults): CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/globals.clp:346+ (BRT defaults, Whips[1],
  subsets, typed/g-variants, ORk options)
  - App-specific globals (e.g., Sudoku uniqueness, deadly patterns, expansions): SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/
  globals.clp:1

  Deliverable: a table-like bullet list of key toggles, defaults, and impact, grouped by concern (rule selection,
  behavior, print, performance).

  Plan Phase 7 — Resolution Theory and Rule System

  - BRT (singles + ECP): CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/ECP.clp:31, app singles (NS/HS) in .../GENERAL/NS.clp, .../
  GENERAL/HS.clp
  - Chains:
      - Core chain families (bivalue, z-chains, t-whips, whips, g-whips, braids), typed vs untyped
      - ORk forcing/contrad variants and partial chains: CSP-Rules-Generic/CHAIN-RULES-EXOTIC/*
      - Speed vs memory implementations: CSP-Rules-Generic/CHAIN-RULES-SPEED/* and ...-MEMORY/*
  - App-specific patterns (e.g., Sudoku Subsets, uniqueness, deadly patterns, templates as patterns): SudoRules-
  V20.1/SUBSETS/, .../UNIQUENESS/, .../TEMPLATES/Templates[1].clp
  - Search augmentations: T&E(n), DFS, focused eliminations, preferences modules.

  Deliverable: an ordered rule activation overview with saliences and when links are computed (init-links) vs when
  play starts.

  Plan Phase 8 — Quality Gates

  - Automated tests: likely none in typical unit-test form (no test frameworks found).
  - Quality via large-scale run stats: SudoRules-V20.1/STATS/*, batch solvers in .../solve-files.clp (timings,
  density, counts).
  - Local validation plan:
      - Prepare a small curated set of puzzles (Sudoku + 1 other app) to exercise rule families.
      - Record timings, max depths, rule usage, and verify solutions.
      - Optional: use preferences to compare different resolution theories.

  Deliverable: a repeatable script/checklist and captured metrics.

  Plan Phase 9 — Performance & Limits

  - Instrumentation:
      - Timers and counters already printed by solve routines: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/solve.clp:63
      - Watchers for ad‑hoc deep dives: (watch rules/facts), toggled on/off to keep runs fast.
  - Scalability parameters:
      - Chain implementation mode (?*chain-rules-optimisation-type*)
      - Print verbosity (expensive logging)
      - ORk‑whips max length, T&E/DFS depth, typed/g-variants, uniqueness patterns.
  - Memory management hooks (e.g., (release-mem) in batch paths).

  Deliverable: guidance bullets with recommended fast vs thorough settings and known heavy options.

  Plan Phase 10 — Naming, Conventions, Mental Model (Most Important)

  - Naming patterns:
      - Files and directories by technique/class: WHIPS, Z-CHAINS, T-WHIPS, SUBSETS, UNIQUENESS, etc.
      - Rule names in traces map to technique families (e.g., whip[n], biv-chain, z-chain, hidden-single-in-
  a-row).
      - Variable/type naming: rc/rn/cn/bn (Sudoku), candidate statuses (cand, c-value), label, glabel, link/glink.
  - Coding conventions in CLIPS:
      - deftemplate for data contracts, defrule with salience to sequence phases, deffunction for utilities.
      - Globals named ?*Name*, many toggles controlled in config + app/global files.
  - Extension mental model:
      - New puzzle: define app templates extending candidate/g-candidate, map variables and labels, implement
  labels-linked and type‑specific link checks in GENERAL/background.clp, then bring in generic rules and write
  app-specific ones as needed. Mirror Sudoku’s app structure.
  - “Blocked/unblocked” behavior: controlled interruption of rule applications (config flags) and its impact on
  completeness vs speed.

  Deliverable: a crisp “how to extend” recipe and a crosswalk from filenames/rules to user‑visible techniques.

  Plan Phase 11 — Comparison With Traditional CSP Solvers

  - Same:
      - Operates on finite domains, maintains candidates, performs constraint propagation.
      - Uses binary constraints; non‑binary constraints are transformed by introducing extra variables.
  - Different:
      - Forward‑chaining rule‑based engine (CLIPS + RETE) vs typical backtracking with AC/GAC and search.
      - Emphasis on pattern‑based resolution rules (chains, whips, braids) with a single stream of reasoning (no
  OR branching within patterns).
      - Introduces additional CSP‑variables (e.g., rn/cn/bn for Sudoku) as a systematic modeling choice.
      - Optional T&E/DFS augmentations integrated into the same rule system.
  - Evidence to cite: README.md:1 (approach), SudoRules-V20.1/GENERAL/solve.clp:1184 (pattern traces), SudoRules-
  V20.1/GENERAL/background.clp:407,430 (link semantics), CSP-Rules-Generic/CHAIN-RULES-* (pattern families).

  Deliverable: a short side‑by‑side bullet comparison grounded in code references.

  Plan Phase 12 — Directory Map

  - High level bullets mapping each top-level dir to its role, with 1–2 subpaths per application (Loaders,
  GENERAL, SUBSETS/EXOTIC/UNIQUENESS, STATS).
  - Note external/optional dirs (XTERNS) and config files at repo root.

  Deliverable: compact directory map.

  Plan Phase 13 — Glossary (to produce in overview.md)

  - Candidate, c-value: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/templates.clp:79
  - g-candidate/glabel: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/templates.clp:101
  - csp-variable and typed csp-variable: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/templates.clp:123
  - label, links, glinks, csp-links: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/init-links.clp:63, app background: SudoRules-V20.1/
  GENERAL/background.clp:407,430
  - BRT (Basic Resolution Theory), Singles (NS/HS), ECP: CSP-Rules-Generic/GENERAL/ECP.clp:31, app NS/HS in .../
  GENERAL
  - Chain families: whips, z-chains, t‑whips, g‑whips, braids; ORk‑whips; typed variants: CSP-Rules-Generic/CHAIN-
  RULES-*
  - T&E(n), DFS, “context”: CSP-Rules-Generic/T&E+DFS/*, candidate context slot
  - Blocked/unblocked behavior; salience; preferences; density
  - App‑specific terms (e.g., Subsets, Unique Rectangles, Deadly Patterns, Tridagons, Templates[1])

  Deliverable: a succinct glossary with each term, one‑line definition, and a code pointer.

  Phase 14 — Evidence & Artifacts To Capture

  - One or two end‑to‑end solve transcripts (short, with technique lines).
  - A “fast” and a “thorough” config snapshot (selected flags).
  - A small perf table of timings and density for 3–5 puzzles.
  - A minimal ASCII architecture/data flow diagram.

  Investigation Aids (rg/CLIPS)

  - Search toggles: rg -n "defglobal \\?\\*.*\\*|bind \\?\\*" CSP-Rules-Generic SudoRules-V20.1
  - Entry points: rg -n "deffunction\\s+solve|solve-.*grid" SudoRules-V20.1
  - Rules by family: browse CSP-Rules-Generic/CHAIN-RULES-*, SudoRules-V20.1/SUBSETS, .../UNIQUENESS
  - CLIPS REPL: (watch rules), (unwatch rules), (matches <rule-name>) for spot checks.
